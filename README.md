# Finnaâ€™s repository for the application of EAD3 and LIDO formats in Finna

This repository contains application profiles and guidelines for using EAD3 and LIDO metadata formats with Finna. The guidelines are organized into format-specific folders.

## EAD3 Format Template

The folder related to the EAD3 format currently contains an XML-based EAD3 template. This template describes which fields of the [EAD3 schema version 1.1.2](https://www.loc.gov/ead/EAD3taglib/index.html) Finna requires and recommends using, as well as the format in which the information should be presented in these fields. By following this template, you ensure that the data is compatible with Finna's quality requirements and technical requirements. Additional guidelines for using the EAD3 format in Finna can be found in [Finna's customer wiki](https://www.kiwi.fi/x/RhRiBQ).

### The latest version

The latest version of the template is named "EAD3-tasot-erikseen-validoitu-versio-1_6.xml". The template may be updated, and the latest versions will be added to the EAD3 folder.

## LIDO Format Template and Application Profile

The repository will be supplemented with guidelines related to the LIDO format at a later date. Currently, the LIDO format template and application profile are not yet available but will be added to the repository in the future.
